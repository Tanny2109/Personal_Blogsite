# Welcome to my First Blog!

Here I write about stuff happening in my life, showcasing my digital art 
works and just introducing you all to my amazing and numerous alternate personalities!

So, who is this guy who wants you to know more about him and why?

The guy I am talking about is Tanmay. A university student studying in 
a remote, cute little French town named Metz('t' is silient cause its a French name 
and hence kinda weird).

This blogsite idea came up to me after I felt a sudden inspiration to create something over the weekend.

And here we are! 

Being a Computer Science graduate and someone who has worked as a Web Developer, it was no
brainer that I make my own website instead of taking the easy way of using something like Wordpress.
(no offense to people who can't code, I find you guys super cute UwU). I will write a separate blog
detailing about how I made this simple blogsite and how I hosted it for free. Stay tuned for that!

I have had some very weird and goofy experiences in my life, and I think they can make
people smile. Since I want to get some good karma by making others smile, I decided to
make my own blogsite and share my stories purely for shelfish reasons. 

You may find the writer to be a small and a cute guy, with a childish personality, but I am 
already warning you, there is a devil hiding behind that cuteness. Maybe the devil inside
me looks like this

But, at the end of the day, its a devil. So, be warned!

Hope so that you will have fun reading my stories!

Cheers and Au Revoir!!
